"""Extract the published description (the Summary section) from a script's
doc file, and/or list the screenshots it references.

The `.md` file next to each userscript holds, in its `## Summary` section,
the user-facing description we post to script repository sites like Greasy
Fork. Those sites strip the images out of the description and show them in
a separate gallery, so this script can either drop the images from the text
or list them on their own.

When the images are stripped, the per-image labels in the doc go with them
and a gallery of several images ends up unlabeled. Such a doc names its
gallery with a comment line above its images:

  <!-- image-gallery-heading: **Search page before and after:** -->

That line is invisible in the doc itself, is dropped from the full text,
and is emitted at the end of the `--no-images` text, where it lands
directly above the gallery. A doc with a single image needs no comment —
its one label already reads as the gallery's heading, so it's kept.

Usage:
  extract-description.py sites/strava.com/fix-climb-slider.md
  extract-description.py --no-images sites/strava.com/fix-climb-slider.md
  extract-description.py --images sites/strava.com/fix-climb-slider.md
